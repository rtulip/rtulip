# About Me!
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rtulip

I'm a fresh grad from the University of Victoria, who studied Software Engineering. I've been worked primarially on firmware and embedded systems for companies like [Ecoation Innovative Solutions](https://www.ecoation.com/), [BRNKL](https://www.brnkl.io/), and [Rostrum Medical Innovations](https://www.rostrummedical.com/). I primarially work in C/C++, but love to pull out Rust when I can.

Currently I'm looking for work while experimenting with making a simple programming language: [tlp](https://github.com/rtulip/tlp).

# Projects
I've always been interested in understanding how low-level systems work and how to build them. Here's some of my cooler projects I've worked on:
* Non-Standard RTOS for an Arduino ATMega2560: [RTC-RTOS](https://github.com/rtulip/RTC-RTOS)
* Stateful Entity Component System & Pong Demo: [cpp-secs](https://github.com/rtulip/cpp-secs)
* Secure Messaging Interface: [Link](https://gitlab.csc.uvic.ca/courses/2021091/SENG360/teams/group-24/group24assignment3)
